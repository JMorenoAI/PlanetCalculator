# PlanetCalculator

This program is design to use pre-defined average distances from the sun and calculate the distance between two planets the user wants to know.  The program uses a tuple to store the hard coded values and uses methods to unpack the tuple, display the data, get user input and run the program.  Users will enter two numbers between one through eight that represents a planet starting at the closest planet to the fartherest planet from the sun, and calculate the distance between them.  If the user wants to exit, the user will input 0 and the program will shut down.
