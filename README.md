# PlanetCalculator

This program is design to use pre-defined average distances from the sun and calculate the distance between two planets the user wants to know.  The program uses a tuple to store the hard coded values and uses methods to unpack the tuple, display the data, get user input and run the program.  Users will enter two numbers between one through eight that represents a planet starting at the closest planet to the fartherest planet from the sun, and calculate the distance between them.  If the user wants to exit, the user will input 0 and the program will shut down.

## Getting Started
To get started, download the PlanetCalculatorCode.py file and to your computer. Then, open up the PlanetCalculatorCode.py file in an IDE of your choice and run the program.

## Prerequisites
In order to use this program, you will need to have Python 3.0 or higher installed on your computer.

## Usage
The program will prompt you to enter the planet you would like to calculate the distance from. Enter the planet's number, and the program will calculate the distance and provide you with the result.
